             <h7>I love chess. I play often with my brother and my best friend-(Devam). Chess is a board game played between two players it tests your ability to think ahead and straightens out your brain.The aim of the game is to make the King checkmated meaning it can't move anywhere. My favourite player is Magnus Carlsen, he is a Norweigen Chess Grandmaster. My favoutite pieces have to be:<br>
             <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
